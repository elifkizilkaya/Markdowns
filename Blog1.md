When you hear the word ‘testing’ or ‘quality assurance’, as a non-technical individual, maybe the first thing that comes to your mind is a group of people sitting at their desks and looking preoccupied 
with their screens trying to click everywhere on a new web/mobile application to see if something goes wrong. Well, you are not far from the truth, this type of testing is called Manual Testing.

Manual testing is an integral part of software development and can be a difficult task to master. It requires patience and a keen eye for details to ensure that all defects in the application are identified 
and addressed. Manual testing is a time-consuming, expensive, and tedious process, where testers have to perform the test manually over and over, and it is almost impossible to repeat the exact same test again. 
However, more modern ways have been invented and applied for quite some time. Depending on machines instead of humans to do the testing provides another type of testing called Automated Testing. 


Automated testing is a form of software testing that uses specialized tools to automatically execute tests and report results. This might ring a bell and remind you of every time you sign up for something the page 
asks you if you are a robot :). Automated testing is used to increase test coverage and reduce the time and cost associated with manual testing. Automated testing can be used for a variety of testing types, 
such as unit, integration, and regression tests. It can also be used to test the functionality of a wide range of applications, from enterprise web applications to mobile applications. Automated testing is an 
essential part of the software development process, and it can help ensure the quality and reliability of an application. By automating tests, developers can quickly identify and fix any issues that may arise 
during the development process. Comparing automated testing to manual testing can sure sound a lot intriguing and exciting, where we benefit from using machines to do the testing, on contrary to manual testing 
which depends solely on humans. After all, machines don’t get bored, sick, or tired of doing the same exact job every single day. However, as glamorous as automated testing can look, it has a huge drawback!

Automated testing can be tricky to get right, as it requires careful planning and execution, in addition to a great deal of technical knowledge and highly advanced skill sets. Automated testing could save 
more time than manual testing does, but it still consumes more time that the development team may not have available with the accelerated production and agile development methodology. As a business owner, 
you might think twice before asking your QA team to adopt an automated testing approach, even though it has all of the amazing advantages that were mentioned above. You might think to yourself, What if there 
was a way to benefit from automated testing without having to invest time, effort and money into coding those test scripts? Codeless Automated Testing is the answer you are looking for.
