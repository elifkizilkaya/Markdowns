As businesses continue to embrace a digital-first approach, automated testing is becoming increasingly important to ensure the quality and reliability of products. More explicitly, 
codeless automated tests are the way to go as a great solution to test applications quickly and easily. We discussed before the perks and benefits of codeless (low-code) automated testing, It allows
testers to quickly and efficiently test the application/product and catch bugs before they reach the end-users. However, that’s not always the case! When codeless automated testing is not done the right way, 
it could show shortcomings in accuracy and test coverage. As we emphasize that codeless automated testing is the right thing to do, that’s not enough to show how amazing it is… 
because doing the right thing alone is not enough, doing it RIGHT is the key to your testing and quality assurance success.

Let’s say you are on your first steps at this codeless automated testing experience; to be able to get the most out of it with as little fuss as possible, we offer you some perspective points and practical 
tips on how to masteryour codeless automated tests regardless of your technical background. Before starting your journey, first you need to finish the following checklist:

<br><br>

Goals and motivation awareness: Understand the purpose of your automated tests. Before you begin, make sure you understand why you’re running the tests and what you’re trying to achieve. This will help you create tests that are more effective and efficient.
Prioritize Testing: The first step in improving automated tests is to prioritize testing. Automated testing should be integrated into the development process from the beginning. This ensures that bugs are caught early in the development cycle, saving time and resources in the long run. By prioritizing testing, you can also ensure that your testing process is robust and thorough.
Choose the Right Tools: Choosing the right codeless automated testing tools is crucial for improving your testing process. There are many testing tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. It is important to choose a tool that is suitable for your application and team. Factors to consider when choosing a testing tool include cost, ease of use, support, and the ability to integrate with other tools in your development stack.
Write Testable Code: Writing testable code is an important step in improving automated testing. Testable code is code that is easy to test, with clear inputs and outputs. By writing testable code, you can ensure that your automated tests are effective and efficient. Some tips for writing testable code include using meaningful variable names, keeping functions small and focused, and making sure to include unique properties for your application elements as much as possible.
Continuous Integration: Continuous integration is the process of automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes. By integrating automated testing into your continuous integration process, you can catch bugs and issues early on in the development cycle. This ensures that your code is always working as expected, and reduces the risk of bugs being introduced into production.
